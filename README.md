# Personal Car Inventory

## Description:
This program is to help those who have too many cars to count. This program asks the user for a small description of their car and then catagorizes it. After the user is done inputing his cars, the program automatically saves the file to a text file named "carsList.txt". If the file does not exist, the program creates it.

## Execution:
The installation of this program is very simple. Simply download the cars.py file and run the program in your terminal/command prompt. Type python followed by the location and name of the file. The carsList.txt file should be created in the same location as this program.
